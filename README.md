# DU-TRISCAN-TIMER

A quick and dirty timer for territory scanners requiring only a programming board.

You can adjust the duration in the lua parameters (15 min by default).

You can now set an alarm sound in the lua parameters. It will play a mp3 named "ts_complete.mp3"

use alt+5 (option 5)  to exit the board and close the timer.

## How to use this script

In order to hear a sound, you will need to add a mp3 file named "[ts_complete.mp3](ts_complete.mp3)" in your folder `My documents\NQ\DualUniverse\audio`

To use the default sound, create "audio" folder if necessary and then copy paste the mp3 file found in this folder 

Then copy the content of [programming_board.json](programming_board.json) and paste the code in a programming board
